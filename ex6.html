        ATM is a cell network. A cell is a small data unit of fixed size that is the basic unit of
        data exchange in a cell network. In this type of network, all data are loaded into identical
        cells that can be transmitted with complete predictability and uniformity. Cells are multiplexed with other cells and routed through a cell network. Because each cell is the
        same size and all are small, any problems associated with multiplexing different-sized
        packets are avoided. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Eligendi dolor saepe ut veritatis iusto dolorem quod ea itaque ducimus autem esse sed beatae, unde aliquam architecto animi, nulla officiis obcaecati?

        ATM uses asynchronous time-division multiplexing—that is why it is called
        Asynchronous Transfer Mode—to multiplex cells coming from different channels. It
        uses fixed-size slots the size of a cell. ATM multiplexers fill a slot with a cell from
        any input channel that has a cell; the slot is empty if none of the channels has a cell
        to send.

        the clock, channel 2 has no cell (empty input slot), so the multiplexer fills the slot with
        a cell from the third channel. When all the cells from all the channels are multiplexed,
        the output slots are empty

        ATM is a switched network. The user access devices, called the end points, are
        connected to the switches inside the network. The switches are connected to each other
        using high-speed communication channels. Figure 3.33 shows an example of an ATM
        network.
