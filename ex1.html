		<h1>HTML5 Accessibility Online Appendix</h1>
		<br>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>
			According to the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative, your web pages and applications should
			be accessible so that “people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact
			with the web, and that they can contribute to the web.”1 In an online appendix, we enumerate 			accessibility issues you should consider when designing web pages and web-based applications. We 			also provide resources that show you how to use HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and
			various design techniques to create accessible web pages and applications. As appropriate, we
			tie the information in this appendix back to the appropriate chapters and sections so that you
			can see how the applications may be enhanced to improve web accessibility
